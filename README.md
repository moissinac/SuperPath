SuperPath
=========

Proposed extension for SVG

For now, conceived as a proof of concept, but can be useful and seems working well. 

If you write a scientific paper and use that code, thank's to cite me as follow:

**SuperPathExpander.js**

Script which expand instances of the superpath extension to produce a standard 
SVG 1.1 file. Implements L, l, Q, q, C, c, T, t, S, s, a, A, h, H, v, V

A typical usage is:

- add this script in your svg file with the line
```
  <script type="application/ecmascript" xlink:href="SuperPathExpander.js" />
```

- add that code for the onload event in the main svg element
```
 onload="superpath.expandPaths()"
```

Then, the principle is to define chunk of path as part of a path by associating id to that part, then to use it with the commands # or ! in the data for other path. The chunk is then defined after translation in a sequence of relatives commands deduced from tha source path. 

```
#idOfMyChunk|
```
insert a copy of the chunk with id idOfMyChunk (a | must follow the id; it's the separator with what follows)

```
!idOfMyChunk|
```
insert a copy of the chunk with id idOfMyChunk  (a | must follow the id; it's the separator with what follows) but after reversing the commands (from the end to the begining, and processing them to follow the same geometry from the end to the begining)
